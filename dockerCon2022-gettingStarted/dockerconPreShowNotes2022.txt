Hello world

first command: docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
	- running this creates a small container on port 80
	- localhost/turotial
	- maintains a docker page on this address explaining the getting started process
		-d - run the container in detached mode (in the background)
		-p 80:80 - map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container
		docker/getting-started - the image to use
	- The name is randomly created

A container is a runtime (active process) that will be running on your machine. DockerHub is a 
place to find them. Let's try installing Fedora via Docker.

*Tags*

Associated with the container. 
If you don't specify the tag (at least for Fedora), it will default to 'latest'.

With docker, we're only pulling the base image that we need to get the system running.
	-> intead of 2GB, it's 54mb. Using the resources on the host machine, you can avoid downloading 
	things that would otherwise be needed if you wanted the full OS.

	docker run --help //this is where all the options are

	docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

	docker run fedora echo hello world //prints hello world

	docker run -i -t fedora //allows for a cmd prompt with a stdin command to work.

	yum install figlet

	figlet hello world

	exit


run creates a completely new container from the base. The things (figlet) that were added are independent to the previous container before - completely separate file systems. 

Theoretically, you can run any container on any host (disclaimer: windows typically needs to be running on windows)
The old containers are still on the hard drive for you to re-use.

Typically, you're not using the interactive command line version, though! The CLI mode is mostly for debugging. Usually it's a non-interactive way. Detaching is a good option.

docker run -d jpetazzo/clock

From the docker desktop app, you can stop this (even though it's running "in the background"), but you can also stop it from the command line.


docker ps

most commands in docker run on container ids



docker run jpetazzo/clock
docker stop <name>

OR

docker stop <container ID>

docker logs -f --tail 3 5eee74533141

figlet/Dockerfile

Before the break, we were using figlet to display text. Too many steps to actually install, build, and then type figlet. We want the image to take in words and just have it execute. This is more real-world because we just want the docker image to do what we want it to do. 

Dockerfiles allow us to do this. Here are some keywords:

FROM - pulls a base image
RUN - issues a command to the docker image

every time you change the docker file, everything after the line change will be invalidated and will have to be run again.

docker build -it figlet . //creates an image that has figlet on a Fedora base.

docker run -it figlet //runs the fedora figlet tagged image.

docker build -t retroflux/figlet:latest .  //pushes the image to dockerhub

you can then push it to the docker hub through docker desktop, and then pull it with 

docker pull retroflux/figlet
